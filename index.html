            <b>DAY 01</b><h3>Kickoff</h3><p>Today marks the official start of our website design journey! As a pair, we gathered to lay the foundation for our digital presence.
                                            We defined our core aesthetic principles, including color palettes, typography hierarchy, and layout frameworks, while selecting a 
                                            primary color scheme and secondary accents to ensure brand consistency across all pages. Although we haven't set up Git yet, we're 
                                            planning to initialize our repository structure with dedicated branches for design assets, documentation, and iterative development.
                                            We've also scheduled weekly syncs to review progress and adjust our approach, ensuring we build a cohesive, scalable design system from day one.</p>

        <div class="post" onclick="openFullArticle('DAY 02', 'A busy day', 'Building the core. I focused on semantic HTML to ensure our site is accessible and well-structured from the ground up.', 'Kazandra')">
            <b>DAY 02</b><h3>A busy day</h3><p>Today, I focused on completing my exercises in networking and other subjects that need to be passed. While working on my 
                                               networking laboratory exercises, I had an online meet with friends to collaborate and help each other. It was great to 
                                               have their support and insights, especially when tackling challenging concepts. This teamwork approach made the 
                                               learning process more enjoyable and effective, ensuring I could review and understand the material better. I'm looking
                                               forward to continuing this collaborative effort to stay on track with all my subjects.</p>

            <b>DAY 03</b><h3>Productive Day</h3><p>Today was a normal day focused on reviewing for the supposed quiz in our subject. I spent most of my time going over the
                                               material to ensure I was well-prepared. After finishing my review, I also took care of some household chores, including 
                                               washing clothes and dishes. Once everything was done, I took a short rest to recharge, as I needed to meet with my mom 
                                               and run some errands later. It was a productive day, balancing study and personal tasks effectively.</p>

            <b>DAY 04</b><h3>Daily Balance</h3><p>Today started with waking up early to get ready for school. When I arrived, I waited for my friends since they said they 
                                               were on their way. Once they arrived, we went to the faculty to choose our topics for one of our subjects. Our first subject has a recitation every after 
                                               each discussion, which I’m okay with since I managed to answer some of the questions. The day was tiring, especially since I also need to do chores when I 
                                               get back home. Despite the exhaustion, I feel like I accomplished a lot today.</p>

        <div class="post" onclick="openFullArticle('DAY 05', 'Art', 'Polishing the style. I updated the color palette variables to make the lavender shades more cohesive across the site.', 'Kazandra')">
            <b>DAY 05</b><h3>Art</h3><p>Today was a nice balance of getting things done and letting my creativity flow! After finishing up my tasks for a few subjects, I finally had some time to 
                                        sit down and draw. It’s been a while since I just relaxed with my art supplies, and it felt so good to lose myself in colors and shapes. I started a small 
                                        sketchbook just for fun, and I’m already loving how it’s turning out. Sometimes, it’s easy to get caught up in deadlines, but taking a moment to create 
                                        something just for myself is such a nice reset. Plus, it’s a great way to unwind after a busy day.</p>

            <b>DAY 06</b><h3>Meaningful Day</h3><p>Today started with a simple yet essential task: washing my clothes. There’s something oddly satisfying about folding freshly laundered items, knowing 
                                                   they’ll be ready for tomorrow. After that, I headed to the kitchen to cook a meal for us to share. Food has a way of bringing people together, and 
                                                   today was no exception. We sat down, ate, and had a nice talk—just enjoying each other’s company and sharing stories from our day. Besides the cooking, 
                                                   I also managed to finish some school tasks. It felt good to check things off my to-do list, even if they were small. Sometimes, those little victories 
                                                   make a big difference in how we feel about the day.
                                                   Overall, it was a day filled with small joys—from the warmth of a shared meal to the quiet satisfaction of getting things done. It’s moments like these 
                                                   that remind me how important it is to appreciate the simple things in life.</p>
